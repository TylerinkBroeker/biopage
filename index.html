            Greetings, Traveler! I’m originally from Miami, Florida, but love the seasons, mountains, and 
            beautiful hiking the west coast has to offer. When I’m not on the trail, I play video games to 
            get lost in a good story or world-build.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a dreamer by birth and a persistent son-of-a-(lovely woman) by trade. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to learn and use new skills. Whether it be studying Gaelic, practicing the viola, picking 
            up archery, or changing my career path to software development, I am diligent in honing recently 
            developed areas of expertise and am able to prioritize tasks and ambitions well.
          </p>
          <p>
            UC San Diego Extension in full-stack web development has taught me many tools of the trade 
            (JavaScript, jQuery, ES6, React.js, Node, Express, API's, JSON, AJAX, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, and 
            Heroku) and I’ve become adept at HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and other CSS frameworks as a result. 
            However, as with my hobbies, I am excited to continue learning and am looking forward to 
            becoming adept at many more languages and technologies. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have several years of experience in the service and retail industry, with some time spent in 
            the legal profession, assisting disabled plaintiffs seeking justice for public websites without 
            accessible formats for the blind. In retail, I have earned the confidence of my managers and 
            peers for being trustworthy, accountable, competent, kind, and hard working.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am looking forward to finding a new career in the field, and hope to become part of a team 
            that values the work ethic, enthusiasm, and skills I have to offer.
          </p>
